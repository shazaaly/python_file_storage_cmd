Python Topics
This repository contains code examples for learning Python topics like serialization, file storage, cmd, and OOP.

Serialization
Serialization is the process of converting an object into a format that can be stored or transmitted. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as JSON, XML, or pickle.

The serialization directory contains code examples for serializing and deserializing objects using JSON and pickle.

File Storage
File storage is the process of storing data in a file. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as text files, binary files, or databases.

The file_storage directory contains code examples for storing and retrieving data from text files, binary files, and databases.

Cmd
The cmd directory contains code examples for creating a command-line interface (CLI) for a Python application.

OOP
OOP is a programming paradigm that allows you to create objects that have their own data and behavior.

The oop directory contains code examples for creating and using OOP objects.
